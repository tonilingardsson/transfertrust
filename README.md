# **TransferTrust**  
A decentralized application (dApp) for secure verification and transfer of real assets, utilizing blockchain technology for transparency, efficiency, and trust. This is my final project for my remote studies as a Blockchain Developer at Medie Institutet, Stockholm.

## **Overview**  
TransferTrust aims to streamline ownership transfers of assets like vehicles, real estate, and equipment by:  
- Providing immutable records of asset conditions.  
- Ensuring secure and transparent transactions between parties.  
- Reducing reliance on intermediaries and minimizing disputes.  

## **Features**  
- **Asset Verification**: Generate and share detailed asset status reports.  
- **Ownership Transfer**: Smart contract-based ownership transfers on the blockchain.  
- **Blockchain Integration**: Powered by Moralis and Solidity for secure and scalable interactions.  
- **User-Friendly Interface**: React-based front-end for seamless user experience.  

## **Tech Stack**  
- **Front-End**: React.js  
- **Smart Contracts**: Solidity  
- **Blockchain Framework**: Moralis  
- **Testing**: Hardhat  
- **Deployment**: Netlify (front-end), Moralis (smart contracts)  
- **Storage**: IPFS (optional for asset documentation)  

## **Installation**  
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash  
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/TransferTrust.git
